## Tasks

### Task ID: 001

- **Title**: Implement Enhanced Ollama Response Converter
- **File**: src/utils/ollama_response_converter.py
- **Complete**: [x]

#### Prompt:

```markdown
**Objective:** Create a comprehensive response converter that handles all Ollama → Graphiti schema mappings to fix schema validation failures in background processing.

**File to Create/Modify:** src/utils/ollama_response_converter.py

**User Story Context:** As a user adding memories with Ollama, I need my memory operations to actually store data instead of failing silently during background processing, so that my AI assistant can access and use the stored memories effectively.

**Prerequisite Requirements (do before writing any application code):**
1. Initialize the Memory or Session Awareness Protocol
2. Use context7 for the most up-to-date documentation and code samples
3. Add the test coverage to verify the accuracy of the code in accordance with the Testing-Driven Development Strategy

**Technical Context:**
Current issue: Memory operations appear successful ("queued for processing") but fail during background processing due to schema mismatch. Graphiti Core expects `{"extracted_entities": [...]}` but gets raw Ollama format with `"entity"` fields that need mapping to `"name"` fields.

**Detailed Instructions:**

Create a comprehensive OllamaResponseConverter class that:

1. **Schema Detection**: Automatically detect target schema types (ExtractedEntities, etc.)
2. **Format Conversion**: Convert Ollama response formats to expected Graphiti schemas
3. **Entity Field Mapping**: Map "entity" → "name" fields in entity arrays
4. **Flexible Handling**: Support both direct responses and nested validation scenarios
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if conversion fails
6. **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging edge cases

**Implementation Requirements:**

\```python
class OllamaResponseConverter:
    def convert_structured_response(self, response_data: dict, target_schema: type) -> dict:
        """
        Convert Ollama response format to target schema format.
        Handles both direct responses and nested validation scenarios.
        """
        # Detect ExtractedEntities schema requirement
        if self._is_extracted_entities_schema(target_schema):
            return self._convert_to_extracted_entities(response_data)

        # Handle other schema patterns
        return self._convert_generic_schema(response_data, target_schema)

    def _convert_to_extracted_entities(self, data: dict | list) -> dict:
        """Convert Ollama entity array to ExtractedEntities format."""
        # Implementation details for entity field mapping

    def _is_extracted_entities_schema(self, schema: type) -> bool:
        """Detect if target schema is ExtractedEntities type."""

    def _convert_generic_schema(self, data: dict, target_schema: type) -> dict:
        """Handle other schema conversion patterns."""
\```

**Acceptance Criteria (for this task):**
- [ ] OllamaResponseConverter class created with all required methods
- [ ] Schema detection works for ExtractedEntities and other patterns

   - Find where Graphiti Core creates LLM clients directly
   - Document configuration entry points
   - Identify bypass scenarios

3. **Configuration Flow Analysis**:
   - Trace how LLM client configuration flows through Graphiti Core
   - Identify override opportunities
   - Document initialization patterns

**Research Commands to Execute:**

```bash
# Find all LLM client instantiations in Graphiti Core
find ~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages/graphiti_core/ -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "AsyncOpenAI\|OpenAI(" {} \;

# Find entity extraction call paths

### Task ID: 005

- **Title**: Graphiti Client Configuration Override Implementation
- **File**: src/initialization/graphiti_client.py
- **Complete**: [ ]

#### Prompt:

```markdown
**Objective:** Implement configuration overrides to ensure all Graphiti Core LLM operations use our enhanced OllamaClient instead of creating their own client instances.

**File to Create/Modify:** src/initialization/graphiti_client.py

**User Story Context:** As a user of the memory system, I need all background processing to use the same enhanced Ollama client as direct operations, so that schema validation works consistently across all memory operations.

**Detailed Instructions:**

1. **Ollama Detection Logic**:
   - Detect when configuration specifies Ollama (check base_url for port 11434)
   - Implement robust detection that handles various URL formats
   - Provide fallback for edge cases

2. **Enhanced Client Creation**:
   - Create OllamaClient with response converter integration
   - Pass all configuration parameters correctly
   - Ensure model parameters are properly configured

3. **Graphiti Initialization Override**:
   - Override Graphiti's internal LLM client creation
   - Force use of our enhanced client for all operations
   - Maintain compatibility with other LLM providers

4. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Validate Ollama configuration before client creation
   - Provide clear error messages for configuration issues
   - Ensure graceful fallback for unsupported scenarios

**Implementation Pattern:**

```python
async def create_graphiti_client(config: GraphitiConfig) -> Graphiti:
    """Create Graphiti client with properly configured Ollama handling."""

    # Detect Ollama configuration
    if config.llm.base_url and "11434" in config.llm.base_url:
        # Create enhanced Ollama client with schema mapping
        llm_client = OllamaClient(
            config=config.llm,
            model_parameters=config.ollama_parameters or {}
        )

        # Override Graphiti's internal LLM client creation
        graphiti = Graphiti(
            uri=config.neo4j_uri,
            username=config.neo4j_user,
            password=config.neo4j_password,
            llm_client=llm_client  # Force use of our enhanced client
        )
    else:
        # Standard initialization for other providers
        graphiti = Graphiti.from_config(config)

    return graphiti
```

**Error Handling Requirements**:
