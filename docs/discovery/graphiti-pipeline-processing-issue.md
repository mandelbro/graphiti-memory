# Discovery: Graphiti Pipeline Processing Schema Validation Failure

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Status**: Investigation Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Priority**: High - Blocking memory operations
**Effort**: 1-2 days

## The One-Liner
Fix schema validation mismatch in Graphiti's background processing pipeline that's causing memory operations to queue successfully but fail during entity extraction.

## The Problem

**What's Broken**: Memory operations with Ollama appear to succeed (return "queued for processing") but fail silently during background processing, resulting in no stored memories.

**The Crime Scene**:
```
2025-08-15 19:03:56,761 - Failed to validate parsed data against ExtractedEntities for model gpt-oss:latest:
1 validation error for ExtractedEntities
extracted_entities
  Field required [type=missing, input_value={'entity_type_id': 0, 'en... Client Error Handling'}, input_type=dict]
```

**Why It Matters**: Users get false positive feedback - operations appear successful but memories aren't actually stored. This breaks the core functionality of the memory system.

## Code Archaeology - What We're Actually Dealing With

### Current Implementation Gap

**Location**: Two separate validation layers with different expectations:

1. **OllamaClient Layer** (`src/ollama_client.py:151-196`):
   - ✅ **Fixed**: Handles schema mapping for `ExtractedEntities`
   - ✅ **Working**: Maps Ollama `"entity"` field to expected `"name"` field
   - ✅ **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage confirms this layer works

2. **Graphiti Core Processing Pipeline** (Background processing):
   - ❌ **Still Broken**: Expects original Ollama response format
   - ❌ **Validation Failing**: Core entity extraction doesn't use our schema mapping
   - ❌ **Silent Failure**: Fails during background processing, not user-facing operations

### The Technical Gap

**What Happens**:
1. User calls `add_memory` → Gets "queued for processing" ✅
2. Background job starts processing episode → ✅
3. Graphiti Core calls entity extraction directly → ❌ Bypasses our OllamaClient fixes
4. Core validation expects `{"extracted_entities": [...]}` but gets raw Ollama format ❌
5. Validation fails, memory doesn't store → ❌

**Root Cause**: We fixed the **front-door** (direct OllamaClient usage) but the **back-door** (Graphiti Core's own entity extraction) still hits the original schema mismatch.

## Architecture Decision: How To Actually Fix This

### The Options We Considered

#### 1. **The Band-Aid Approach**: Fix Graphiti Core's Usage
- **What it is**: Modify how Graphiti Core calls the LLM client to use our fixed schema mapping
- **Why it might work**: Minimal changes, leverages existing fix
- **Why it might suck**: We don't control Graphiti Core updates, could regress
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours

#### 2. **The Proper Fix**: Schema Mapping at Source
- **What it is**: Implement schema mapping at the Ollama model configuration level
- **Why it might work**: Fixes the issue at the source, works for all processing paths
- **Why it might suck**: More complex, touches more components
- **Effort**: 1-2 days

#### 3. **The Nuclear Option**: Fork Graphiti Core
- **What it is**: Maintain our own version of Graphiti Core with the fixes
- **Why we're even considering this**: Desperation and tight deadlines
- **What could go wrong**: Maintenance nightmare, miss upstream updates
- **Effort**: Everything

### What We're Going With

**Option 2: Schema Mapping at Source** because:
- Fixes the problem comprehensively for all code paths
- Doesn't require maintaining patches to external dependencies
- Future-proof against Graphiti Core updates
- Better architectural separation of concerns

### Trade-offs We're Accepting
- **More implementation complexity** in exchange for **comprehensive fix**
- **Longer initial development time** in exchange for **no ongoing maintenance burden**

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview

```
Current Broken Flow:
User Request → MCP Tools → Background Queue → Graphiti Core → LLM Client → Ollama
                                                     ↓
                                            Schema Validation Fails ❌

Fixed Flow:
User Request → MCP Tools → Background Queue → Graphiti Core → Enhanced LLM Client → Ollama
                                                     ↓                ↓
                                            Schema Mapping Applied ✅  Response Fixed ✅
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Response Converter (8 hours)
**Goal**: Create a comprehensive response converter that handles all Ollama → Graphiti schema mappings

**Approach**:
```python
# File: src/utils/ollama_response_converter.py

class OllamaResponseConverter:
    def convert_structured_response(self, response_data: dict, target_schema: type) -> dict:
        """
        Convert Ollama response format to target schema format.
        Handles both direct responses and nested validation scenarios.
        """
        # Detect ExtractedEntities schema requirement
        if self._is_extracted_entities_schema(target_schema):
            return self._convert_to_extracted_entities(response_data)

        # Handle other schema patterns
        return self._convert_generic_schema(response_data, target_schema)

    def _convert_to_extracted_entities(self, data: dict | list) -> dict:
        """Convert Ollama entity array to ExtractedEntities format."""
        if isinstance(data, list):
            # Map "entity" → "name" fields
            mapped_entities = []
            for item in data:
                if isinstance(item, dict) and "entity" in item:
                    mapped_item = item.copy()
                    mapped_item["name"] = mapped_item.pop("entity")
                    mapped_entities.append(mapped_item)

            return {"extracted_entities": mapped_entities}

        return data
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All Ollama responses properly convert to expected Graphiti schemas
- Comprehensive test coverage for all schema patterns
- No regression in existing functionality

#### Phase 2: Integration Point Identification (4 hours)
**Goal**: Find all places where Graphiti Core bypasses our OllamaClient

**Approach**:
1. **Trace Background Processing**: Follow the execution path from `add_memory` to actual entity extraction
2. **Identify Direct LLM Calls**: Find where Graphiti Core instantiates LLM clients directly
3. **Hook Integration Points**: Modify configuration to ensure our converter is always used

**Investigation Tasks**:
```bash
# Find all LLM client instantiations
grep -r "AsyncOpenAI\|OpenAI(" ~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages/graphiti_core/

# Find entity extraction call paths
grep -r "ExtractedEntities\|extract.*entit" ~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages/graphiti_core/

# Trace configuration flow
grep -r "llm_client\|LLMConfig" ~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages/graphiti_core/
```

#### Phase 3: Configuration Override (4 hours)
**Goal**: Ensure all Graphiti Core LLM operations use our enhanced OllamaClient

**Approach**: Override LLM client configuration at the Graphiti initialization level:

```python
# File: src/initialization/graphiti_client.py

async def create_graphiti_client(config: GraphitiConfig) -> Graphiti:
    """Create Graphiti client with properly configured Ollama handling."""

    # Create enhanced Ollama client with schema mapping
    if config.llm.base_url and "11434" in config.llm.base_url:  # Ollama detection
        llm_client = OllamaClient(
            config=config.llm,
            model_parameters=config.ollama_parameters or {}
        )

        # Override Graphiti's internal LLM client creation
        graphiti = Graphiti(
            uri=config.neo4j_uri,
            username=config.neo4j_user,
            password=config.neo4j_password,
            llm_client=llm_client  # Force use of our enhanced client
        )
    else:
        # Standard initialization for other providers
        graphiti = Graphiti.from_config(config)

    return graphiti
```

## Risk Analysis - What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

### 🔴 High Risk: Graphiti Core API Changes
**Probability**: Medium (Active development)
**Impact**: Our configuration overrides break
**Mitigation**:
- Pin specific Graphiti Core version until stable
- Add integration tests that verify the fix works end-to-end
- Monitor Graphiti Core releases for breaking changes

**Detection**: Automated tests fail, memory operations start failing again

### 🟡 Medium Risk: Performance Degradation
**Probability**: Low (Minimal overhead)
**Impact**: Slower memory operations
**Mitigation**:
- Benchmark response conversion overhead
- Cache converted schemas where possible
- Profile background processing performance

**Detection**: Response time monitoring shows degradation

### 🟢 Low Risk: Schema Mapping Edge Cases
**Probability**: Low (Comprehensive test coverage)
**Impact**: Some entity formats not handled correctly
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive test suite covering all known Ollama response patterns
- Fallback to original format if conversion fails
- Detailed logging for debugging edge cases

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)
